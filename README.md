**Build production-ready UI without a designer.**<br>
A methodology for creating scalable design systems using AI + Atomic Design + Spec-Driven Development.

## What Is This?

You describe what your product does. You collect visual references. AI generates a complete design system — tokens, components, screens — as production React code. You review in the browser and say "yes" or "fix this."

No Figma. No designer. No coding skills required (for PMs).

```
 You write spec    You pick style    AI generates     You combine      AI builds        AI assembles

## Get Started — Pick Your Role

<table>
<tr>
<td width="33%" valign="top">

### 🎯 I'm a PM / Founder

You write specs, pick visual direction, review results. You don't touch code.

**Your phases:** 1 → 2 → 3 → 4 → Review

**Time to first result:** ~2 hours

[**→ PM Getting Started**](docs/getting-started-pm.md)

</td>
<td width="33%" valign="top">

### ⚡ I'm a Developer

You get structured prompts that produce consistent, token-based components. TypeScript strict, CSS variables, Atomic Design.

**Your phases:** 5 → 6 → Review

**Time to first component:** ~15 minutes

[**→ Developer Getting Started**](docs/getting-started-dev.md)

</td>
<td width="33%" valign="top">

### 🚀 I'm a Solo Founder

You do everything — specs, design decisions, and code. The full pipeline, optimized for one person.

**Your phases:** 1 → 2 → 3 → 4 → 5 → 6

**Time to full DS:** ~1-2 days

[**→ Solo Founder Getting Started**](docs/getting-started-solo.md)

## How It Actually Works (2 minutes)

1. **Write what you're building** — features, user roles, business rules → a PRD
2. **Collect visual inspiration** — screenshots of products you like, with notes
3. **AI generates your design language** — colors, fonts, spacing, components → a UIDD document. Pick from 3 concepts.
4. **Combine into one brief** — "here's what to build and how it should look"
5. **AI builds the components** — paste a prompt, AI writes production code. Watch it appear in the browser.
6. **AI assembles screens** — full pages composed from the components it built. You review.

**That's it.** The magic is in the quality of documents (steps 1-4) and the prompts (steps 5-6). This repo gives you both.

## Core Principles

**Zero Hallucination** — AI will confidently add features you never asked for. Every design element must trace to a source document. If it's not in the spec, it doesn't get built. [Read more →](docs/zero-hallucination.md)

**Momentum Over Perfection** — Build 10 screens at 80% before polishing 2 at 100%. AI context degrades over long sessions. Push forward, batch fixes later. [Read more →](docs/phase-5-build.md#session-strategy-momentum-over-perfection)

**Showcase-Driven** — Every component renders on a live demo page. This IS your Storybook, your Figma preview, and your test suite — always in sync with the code.

## Quick Start

```bash
# 1. Clone
git clone https://github.com/bypshkn/katagami.git

# 2. Pick your role above and follow the getting-started guide

# 3. When ready to build: feed your Design Brief + prompt to your AI tool
```

## Why "Katagami"?

**型紙 (katagami)** — traditional Japanese stencils for dyeing kimono fabric. One stencil, once crafted, stamps a consistent design across meters of silk. You invest effort once into the design system (the stencil), and every screen inherits the same tokens, proportions, and consistency.

*Part of an agent family: Satori (悟り) for discovery, Toranaga for strategy, Miyabi (雅) for design, Kiwari (木割) for architecture, Takumi (匠) for implementation.*

## Default Tech Stack

| Layer | Default | Swap for |
|-------|---------|----------|
| Framework | Next.js 14+ (App Router) | Remix, Nuxt, SvelteKit |
| Styling | Tailwind CSS v4 | CSS Modules, Styled Components |
| Language | TypeScript (strict) | — |
| Icons | Lucide React | Heroicons, Phosphor |

> Katagami is stack-agnostic in methodology. These are defaults, not requirements.
